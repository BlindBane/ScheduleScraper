# ScheduleScraper

This is a script I created to scrape my co-worker's calenders for unbooked interview times.
The script then parses this information, formats it into an email, and sends it to staff
The purpose of this app is to increase efficiency within the team and allocate man hours to where they are needed most 

***

To start using the Schedule scraper, clone down the repo and:

run "npm install"

modify the contents of constants.js to reflect you and the current staff

change the name of auth.example.js to auth.js and fill in relevent fields

run "npm run help" to get started
